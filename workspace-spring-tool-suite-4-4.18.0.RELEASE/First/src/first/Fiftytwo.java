//Exception handling in java
//Checked Exceptions: Checked exceptions are called compile-time exceptions because these exceptions are 
//checked at compile-time by the compiler.
//Unchecked Exceptions: The unchecked exceptions are just opposite to the checked exceptions. 
//The compiler will not check these exceptions at compile time. In simple words, 
//if a program throws an unchecked exception, and even if we didnâ€™t handle or declare it,
//the program would not give a compilation error.
