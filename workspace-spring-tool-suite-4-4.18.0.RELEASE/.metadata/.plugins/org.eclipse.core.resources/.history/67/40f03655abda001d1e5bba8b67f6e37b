//Object cloning

//Object cloning refers to the creation of an exact copy of an object.
//It creates a new instance of the class of the current object and initializes all its
//fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object.

//In Java, there is no operator to create a copy of an object. Unlike C++, in Java,
//if we use the assignment operator then it will create a copy of the reference variable and not the object.

//The object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object. The clone() method of Object class is used to clone an object.

//The java.lang.Cloneable interface must be implemented by the class whose object clone we want to create. 
//If we don't implement Cloneable interface, clone() method generates CloneNotSupportedException.
