//JAVA 8 Streams
//he Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
//A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various 
//methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
//Note: 

//If we want to represent a group of objects as a single entity then we should go for collection.
//But if we want to process objects from the collection then we should go for streams
//If we want to use the concept of streams then stream() is the method to be used.
//Stream is available as an interface.

//Stream s = c.stream();
//In the above pre-tag, ‘c’ refers to the collection. So on the collection, we are calling the stream() method and at the same time, we are storing it as the Stream object. Henceforth, this way we are getting the Stream object.
//
//Note: Streams are present in java’s utility package named java.util.stream

//A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays, or I/O channels.
//Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
//Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. 
//Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
